Capomulin and Ramicane appear to be effective in fighting the tumors, with 2 outliers in Capomulin. I would recommend Capomulin,
to undergo extra study as the 2 outliers are very promising, and there could be a factor not considered responsible.

there appears to be a correlation between, weight and tumor volume.

There appears to be exponential growth for tumors over time. It also appears to be artificial due to the "steps" in increase.(maybe due to genetically engineered mice)
